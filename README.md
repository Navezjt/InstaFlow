## Introduction

Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable promises in text-to-image generation. However, their efficacy is still largely hindered by computational constraints stemming from the need of iterative numerical solvers at the inference time for solving the diffusion/flow processes. 

**InstaFlow** is an ```ultra-fast```, ```one-step``` image generator that achieves image quality close to Stable Diffusion, while requiring significantly reduced computational resources. This efficiency is made possible through a recent [Rectified Flow](https://github.com/gnobitab/RectifiedFlow) technique, which trains probability flows with straight trajectories, hence inherently requiring only a single step for fast inference.

**InstaFlow** has several advantages: 
- ```Ultra-Fast Inference```: **InstaFlow** models are **one-step generators**, which directly map noises to images and avoid multi-step sampling of diffusion models. On our machine with A100 GPU, the inference time is around 0.1 second, saving ~90% of the inference time compared to the original Stable Diffusion.
- ```High-Quality```: **InstaFlow** generates images with intricate details like Stable Diffusion, and have similar FID on MS COCO 2014 as state-of-the-art GAN, [StyleGAN-T](https://github.com/autonomousvision/stylegan-t).
- ```Simple and Efficient Training```: The training process of **InstaFlow** merely involves **supervised training**. Leveraging pre-trained Stable Diffusion, it only takes **199 A100 GPU days** to get **InstaFlow-0.9B**.

## Comparison with SD 1.5 on our A100 machine

For an intuitive understanding, we used the same A100 server and took screenshots from the Gridio interface of random generation with different models. InstaFlow-0.9B is one-step, while SD 1.5 adopts 25-step [DPMSolver](https://github.com/LuChengTHU/dpm-solver). It takes around 0.3 second to download the image from the server. The text prompt is *"A photograph of a snowy mountain near a beautiful lake under sunshine."*
